- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tamass00
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learn new programming languages
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, JavaScript, AWS, Azure and GoogleCloud use, Git, and more....
- My favorite language to programming is Vb.Net using Mysql for local apps.

- I am in a new stage on my life, refreshing my knowledges, catching up on everything about cloud technologies and demostrate myself that the age is not a limit... i'm 41 years old...
